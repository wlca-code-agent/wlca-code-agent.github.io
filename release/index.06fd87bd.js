To automate this process, existing language model-based solutions focus primarily on generating edit solutions based on given location and relevant prior edits. However, editing tasks can be more complicated: It is non-trivial to infer the subsequent edit location, as the scope of edit ripple effect can be the whole project. Moreover, editing sessions may contain multiple (ir)relevant edits. In this talk, I will share our work CoEdPilot, a LLM-driven framework for code evolution assistance. CoEdPilot orchestrates a set of neural Transformers, for discriminating relevant edits, monitoring the ripple effects of edits, exploring their interactive natures and generating edit solution. We also implement CoEdPilot as a VS Code extension for user-friendly interaction.",bio:"Chenyan Liu is currently a PhD student at School of Computing, National University of Singapore.

While automatic test generators like EvoSuite (focused on branch coverage) and LLM-based solutions (focused on code generation) show promising results, they often fall short when it comes to incorporating project-specific domain knowledge. This gap makes the generated tests less practical and harder to pass code review or be integrated into a software product.
In this talk, I will share our work DTester, an LLM-based test generator designed to generate practical project-specific tests. First, our empirical study reveals that sophisticated software projects contain abundant code assets valuable for guiding the generation of new tests. Based on the empirical observation, DTester is designed to retrieve a referable test and adapt it to the target test through LLM-based conversation with the project, thus capturing crucial domain-specific information. We also implement DTester as a VSCode extension to facilitate the practical use of test generation.'`,bio:"Binhang Qi is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at School of Computing, National University of Singapore, working with Professors Jin-Song Dong and Yun Lin.
